About me\
My name is Mykhailo. I spent my adulthood in a small village. Since childhood, I have always been curious about how various mechanisms and technologies work. This became one of the reasons why I decided to pursue studies in mechanical engineering.

After finishing school, I enrolled at the Lviv Polytechnic National University, specializing in mechanical engineering. There, I found answers to many of my questions and learned to apply the knowledge gained during lectures and practical classes.

Throughout my years as a student, I focused on studying different technologies and programming languages. Specifically, I delved into CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, which allowed me to create user-friendly and visually appealing web pages. Additionally, I developed an interest in React, enabling me to build more complex and interactive web applications.
